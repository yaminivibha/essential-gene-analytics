2) Scripts for gene energetics analytics
3) analyzing gene essentiality <-> energetics
4) gene essentiality <-> disease phenotypic association
5) gene essentiality <-> gwas association frequency
6) gene essentiality <-> loss of function associations

Poster - concise summary of work including visualizations and all major citations

Abstract - written <500 word abstract of work
